Difference between document and window object:

Both document and window are important objects in JavaScript that provide access to
different aspects of the web page and browser environment.

Document: (The document object is a property of the window object. It represents the HTML document that's currently loaded in the browser window).

Accessing and modifying HTML elements (getElementById, querySelector, innerHTML)
Manipulating the DOM structure (creating, removing, modifying elements)
Handling events triggered by user interaction (clicks, scrolls, form submissions)
Accessing page title, URL, and character encoding

Window: (The window object is the global object in JavaScript. It represents the entire browser window or tab where your web page is loaded).

Accessing browser dimensions (width, height)
Navigation (reload, back/forward history)
Alerting, confirming, and prompting users (alert(), confirm(), prompt())
Setting and managing timers (setInterval, setTimeout)
Accessing global variables and functions

Think of the window object as your entire house. It represents the whole environment you're working in.
The document object, on the other hand, is like a specific room within the house (the kitchen, living room, etc.).
You can only access the rooms (documents) through the house (window).

In Summary:
The window object provides a broader view and tools to interact with the browser environment.
The document object offers focused functionalities for manipulating the content and structure of the specific web page loaded in the window.
